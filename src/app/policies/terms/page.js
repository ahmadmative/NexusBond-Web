                    <p>
                        We want to emphasize that all conversations between users and AI characters on NexusBond.AI are entirely fictional and should be treated as such. The AI characters are artificial intelligence characters designed to simulate human-like interactions, but they do not possess genuine emotions, intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any elements within the conversations that may resemble reality, such as offers of real-life meetings or promises of tangible outcomes, are entirely fake and should not be taken seriously. We do not assume responsibility for any confusion or misunderstandings that may arise from the fictional nature of the AI conversations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI characters exist solely within the digital realm of the platform, and any expectations or beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or endorsed by NexusBond.AI.
