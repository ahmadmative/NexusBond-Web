                        Information we collect automatically. We and our third-party vendors, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services.

When you connect to us through a Third-Party Account like Facebook or Google, we receive information from that third party identifying your account. We collect and store this information and use it to help you connect to the Services. Connecting your account to a Third-Party Account is completely optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect.

These entities may use cookies and tracking technologies to allow us to, among other things, track and analyze data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and better understand your online activity.

                    <h3>4. Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising
                    </h3>
                    <p>Analytics. We may use third-party web analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These vendors use the sort of technology described in the “Information We Collect Automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by such technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also may use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for web analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.</p>
                    <p>Tailored Advertising. Though we do not engage in advertising as of the date of this Policy, we may in the future allow third-party advertising networks to place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our website and other online services and (b) report how our marketing content impressions and interactions with these marketing impressions are related to visits to our online services. We may also allow other unaffiliated parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may disclose to a vendor in hashed, non-human-readable form.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiatives (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Link, the Digital Advertising Alliances (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out Link, and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To exercise choices about how Google personalizes Display Advertising or to customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content may not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out pages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, or use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective.

                    <p>

                    <p>You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights.</p>

                    <h4>Regional Privacy Disclosures and Rights</h4>
                    <p>Additional disclosures for residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, California, and Nevada are outlined below in <em>Regional Privacy Disclosures</em>.</p>
                </section>

                <section className="section">
    <h3>6. Regional Privacy Disclosures</h3>

    <h4>Residents of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom</h4>
    <p>
        NexusBond.AI is considered the “data controller” of the “personal data” (as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation) we handle under this Policy. In other words, NexusBond.AI is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose personal data, subject to applicable law. The laws of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contractual Commitments:</strong> We may use, share, or disclose personal data to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we will process your personal data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the basis of your consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> In many cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition to those rights described herein, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
    </p>

    <h4>Residents of Nevada</h4>
    <p>
        If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain personal information to unaffiliated parties. You can exercise this right by contacting us as described in the Contact Us section below with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and the email address. We do not currently sell your personal information as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.
    </p>

    <h4>Residents of California</h4>
    <p>
        Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we disclose it. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we also have to provide you with the “categories” of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for business or commercial purposes (as “categories” are defined by the CCPA).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the twelve months leading up to the effective date of this Policy, we have collected and disclosed the categories of personal information described in Section 1 for business or commercial purposes. The categories of personal information are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifiers</li>
        <li>Financial information (such as payment information)</li>
        <li>Commercial or transactional information</li>
        <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
        <li>General geolocation data</li>
        <li>Audio or video information (such as pictures and videos you submit)</li>
        <li>Other information about you that you may provide to us voluntarily, such as through User Content</li>
        <li>Other information that may identify you, and inferences drawn from the information we collect</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also collect the following categories of “sensitive personal information,” as defined under the CCPA:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account</li>
        <li>Other sensitive personal information you may voluntarily provide to us in your capacity as an individual user of the Services (e.g., if you voluntarily post User Content revealing your race, religion, or sexual orientation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We process the categories of personal information identified above for the purposes as described in more detail in Section 2 above.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Directly from you</li>
        <li>Through your use of the Services</li>
        <li>Other parties such as other users and through unaffiliated parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We describe our information disclosure practices in more detail in Section 3, above.
    </p>
    <h4>“Sale” and “Sharing” of Personal Information</h4>
    <p>
        The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” or “share” personal information. Where we refer to “sell” or “share” (or their variants) in quotes, we are referring to those terms as uniquely defined in the CCPA.
    </p>
